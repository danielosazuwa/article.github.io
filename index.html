          RACISM, AN ISSUE TO BE TACKLED

          Racism is one of the striking and horrible ideologies denying human
          equality. After seeing the list of persons who had died as a result of
          racism, I was sad that fellow humans kill people because of their
          colour. This evening a video surfaced online and after watching a
          video of a man named George Floyd exclaiming “I can’t breathe”, the
          Minneapolis officer pinned him to the ground beside the police car and
          put his knee on the man’s neck, the man eventually died, the death of
          George Floyd is also similar to the death of Eric Garner in the year
          2014. In Eric Garner’s case, the officer Pantaleo placed his arms
          around his neck and wrestled him to the ground, until he was
          unconscious and eventually died, the medical examiner ruled Garner’s
          death as a homicide, a Richmond County Grand Jury did not indict
          Officer Pantaleo and he did not face any federal charges. After seeing
          the video that surfaced, I have to speak up in this little way I can,
          by writing this little piece.

          Racism is defined as the belief that one race of people is superior to
          another. Racism can also be defined as the belief of superiority of
          one race over another based on the belief that a group of persons
          possesses behavioural traits corresponding to physical appearance.
          This racism has existed in the hearts of people around the world and
          it is very lethal.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          South Africa Apartheid era (1948-1994), is a racism-related conflict,
          in this era racism touched every aspect of social life, non-whites
          could not marry whites, allowing “white only” jobs, blacks had to
          carry their passbook to access non-black areas, blacks were restricted
          to vote until Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s first black president led
          the fight against South Africa’s Apartheid regime until 1993 when a
          new constitution was drafted to eradicate racism in South Africa. One
          of Nelson’s Mandela quote on racism, “No one is born hating another
          person because of the colour of his skin, or his background, or his
          religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate,
          they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human
          heart than hate its opposite”. Let us work together and teach or
          preach this love to one another and remove this racist ideology
          totally from our lives and learn to live as one.

          Martin Luther King Jr. said, “I have a dream that my four children
          will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the
          colour of their skin, but by the content of their character”. Racists
          view blacks as criminally minded and violent, you do not judge a book
          by its cover, rather we should judge people not by their colour but by
          their character. Racists commit a fallacy of generalization, that a
          particular race is inferior. All races are superior, they are of equal
          status, and no race is superior to the other.

          Racism is an issue that has dominated the news with reports of
          struggles of civil rights, the brutality of the police, demands for
          equality, protests on the issue of racism. We see on headlines, white
          supremacist guilty of killing 2 men who came to aid of black teens,
          white supremacist pleads guilty to killing a black man as practice for
          a racist plot, a white officer charged with murder in the shooting of
          black women, a cop who killed a black man in his home sent racist text
          and many more killings as a result of racism, when will all this end?
          It will end when the world starts seeing each other as one when people
          do not judge people by their race.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For this issue of racism to be tackled, we all have a role to play, we
          have to love ourselves, remove that racist ideology and think of each
          other as one. For example, racist jokes or statements should be
          reported to the appropriate authorities and should not be tolerated.
          The famous South African reggae musician, Lucky Dube has these lyrics
          in one of his songs “Different colours, one people”, we should view
          each other as one people regardless of the race.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Law also has a role to play to tackle racism; racism is against
          natural justice, equity, and good conscience. The legislature can
          enact laws to help eradicate racism in the world and the executive
          should help in enforcing these laws. For example, on October 9, 2018,
          Tunisia’s parliament passed the “Elimination of All Forms of Racial
          Discrimination” Act, the law criminalizes all forms of racial
          discrimination.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The judiciary is not left out of this. The judiciary is the branch of
          government that administers justice according to the law. The
          judiciary must punish these racist according to the racism law of a
          particular country irrespective of the office of the person involved
          in the crime to serve as a deterrent to other racists. Using Eric
          Garner’s case as a case study, the judge did not indict the police
          officer and the police officer didn’t face federal charges, this is
          very wrong, the judiciary is the temple of justice, a wrongdoer is
          supposed to the punished according to the law of a particular
          geographical area.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Public awareness campaigns should be set up. What is a public
          awareness campaign? It is an effort to build public recognition of a
          problem through social media, messaging, and an organized set of
          communication tactics. These campaigns should be set up to make people
          know the adverse effect of their racist ideologies and make them aware
          of the punishment for racist activities. This public awareness
          campaigns should reach out to the public regularly, measuring the
          outreach accurately and motivating the public to take action.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Irrespective of the colour, we are one people; we should abhor the
          idea of superiority or inferiority of a particular race. I commiserate
          with the families, who have lost their loved ones as a result of
          racism.
